##Concept

In order to avoid detection, certain additional steps need to be applied. They are as follows

1. Randomize position of 'the' vote between the other required votes
2. Randomized set of most common (real) names of 'voters'
3. Use disposable email addresses
4. If necessary: use rotating proxies to make ips change
5. Captcha avoidance?
