# For Jeff                          


## Todo

- Add VPN support using openpyn
- Add support for nonocaptcha



##Updates since original commit

###v0.1
- Added the initial song selector and slayer randomizer. It's not completely working yet but getting close
- Added the name generator

###v0.2
- Added email Generator
- Small scroll changes to make sure elements can be found
- Seems to be working up until captcha


##Concept

In order to avoid detection, certain additional steps need to be applied. They are as follows

1. Randomize position of 'the' vote between the other required votes
2. Randomized set of most common (real) names of 'voters'
3. Use disposable email addresses
4. If necessary: use rotating proxies to make ips change
5. Captcha avoidance?
